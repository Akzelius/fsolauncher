# FreeSO Launcher Tools

> **DEPRECATED!** Do not use anything from this folder. `electron-packager` now takes care of building the correct executable.

These tools are used to modify the default Electron executable to add the FreeSO logo and force admin access.

Also contains installer files for software used during the building
process.
